So my Fitbit Flex broke. But I have this Microsoft Band. Carrying two trackers was annoying anyways, so wouldn't it be cool to have the band's steps sync into the Fitbit service on their own?

If you want to try this out or rip parts of it out, just make sure you register with Fitbit as a developer and have your Client ID and Client Secret handy.
